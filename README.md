# Swift Data Structures Playground Book

> A summary of Swift Data Structures written on Playgrounds.

Inspired by [swift-summary](https://github.com/jakarmy/swift-summary) and [swift-algorithm-club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club), this is a personal project to study Data Structures, as I learn the subject, I’ll add to this repository a summary of my study notes.
